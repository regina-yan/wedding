                    <p class="qa-answer">There is indoor lodging in the main building, A-frames (1st image), and outdoor cabins (2nd image - we took this photo in the winter, so disregard the snow). The beds are twin size, most of them bunked. There are shared bathrooms, showers, and drinkable water in the main building and A-frames; and an outdoor outhouse, showers, and drinkable water for the outdoor cabins. The outdoor cabins have a mini rec hall cabin too. Rooms will have 2-10 beds each. We'll do our best to put people in rooms with friends / compatible folks, but please reach out if you have any concerns or requests!</p>
