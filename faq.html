                    <p class="qa-answer">
                        There are 3 types of lodging at camp. We'll do our best to put people in rooms with friends / compatible folks, but please reach out if you have any concerns or requests!
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>Main Building</b>
                        <br/>
                        <img src="assets/main-building.jpeg" class="img-fit-2"/>
                        <br/>
                        The Main Building has indoor lodging with rooms that are connected to the kitchen, living room, and library. Rooms have 2-10 twin-size beds, most of them bunked. There are shared bathrooms with showers on each floor. We'll likely put older relatives and family here. 
                        <br/><br/><br/>
                        <b>A-Frames</b>
                        <br/>
                        <img src="assets/camp-bunk-2.jpeg" class="img-fit-2"/>
                        <br/>
                        The three A-frame cabins are located right next to the main building. There are ~7 twin-size beds and a shared bathroom in each cabin.
                        <br/><br/><br/>
                        <b>Adventure Camp</b>
                        <br/>
                        <img src="assets/camp-adventure-cabin.png" class="img-fit-2"/>
                        <br/>
                        Adventure camp is where the older cool-kids stay during summer camp - it's a little more private and primitive, with screened-in windows and no electricity (I think). There's an outdoor outhouse + outdoor shower, and a shared mini rec hall cabin. Rooms have ~10 beds, maybe a third of them bunked. This is Shep's favorite place to stay, and Regina+Shep will be staying here.

                    <p class="qa-answer">The Main building and wing have heating and A/C, but the A-frames and adventure camp cabins do not. The A-frames are insulated, so warmth should not be an issue at this time of year.</p>

                    <p class="qa-answer">The beds don't have any linens, so you'll need to bring your own (it's just a mattress on the bed, kind of like college!). This is what we recommend for a packing list (in addition to clothing, toiletries, etc.):</p>

Please note that the main building rooms will probably be for family/relatives. Shep would like to note that the outdoor cabins are incredibly nice and would be his preferred choice.</p>
